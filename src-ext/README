Utilities for use with Semantic Vectors.

This branch contains code that has been submitted to the repository
for developers to share, but is not (yet) part of Semantic Vectors
releases.

Because they depend on external dependencies (e.g., Jama,
ParallelColt), these utils are not compiled as part of the standard
SemanticVectors "ant" build target.

If you want to compile these utils, make sure all the necessary
dependencies are in your CLASSPATH and run "ant compile-util".

So far, these utilities include:

***
Visualization code for generating principal component plots
of lists of term vectors.

Author: Dominic Widdows (Google Inc.)

Dependencies: Jama (http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/).

Run using (e.g.) java pitt.util.vectors.PrincipalComponents <SEARCHARGS>
(This is similar to usage for java pitt.search.semanticvectors.ClusterResults)

***
Beagle model implementation. (See http://www.indiana.edu/~clcl/BEAGLE/Jones_Mewhort_PR.pdf)

Author: Lance De Vine, QUT.

Dependencies: ParallelColt (http://sourceforge.net/projects/parallelcolt/)
