This directory should eventually contain tests of as many as possible
of the classes in the src tree. In general, the tests for class
foo in the src tree should be in a parallel class fooTest, e.g., the
file test/pitt/search/semanticvectors/VectorUtilsTest.java contains
the tests for the class defined in
src/pitt/search/semanticvectors/VectorUtils.java

Test classes need to be registered with the appropriate package test
runner to be executed, e.g., the class names for all the tests for
the package pitt.search.semanticvectors must be added to 
test/pitt/search/semanticvectors/RunTests.java

Unfortunately the test suite was added long after the semanticvectors
package shipped, so we are playing catchup with adding tests as an
afterthought. Please consider adding tests to existing code a high
priority. Sooner or later we will probably make a rule that no new
code is to be added without tests.
