/**

Package for orthographic representation, i.e., making vectors based on the
characters that occur in a string.

<p>
The basic idea is to make vectors for positions in the string, which have some natural
ordering position, and to take bindings of the position vectors (no pun intended)
with elemental vectors for the character that occurs in this position, and superposing
these pairs along the string to get a representation for the whole string.
