/**
 * Command line term vector comparison utility designed to be run in
 batch mode. This enables users to
 get raw similarities between two concepts. These concepts may be
 individual words or lists of words. For example, if your vectorfile
 is the (default) termvectors.bin, you should be able to run
 comparisons like

 <br>
 <code>echo 'blue | red green' | java pitt.search.semanticvectors.CompareTermsBatch
 </code>

 <br>
 which will give you the cosine similarity of the "blue"
 vector with the sum of the "red" and "green" vectors.

 <br>
 The process can be set up to accept long lists of piped input without
 requiring the overhead of reloading the lists of vectors, and can store the
 vectors in memory.


 <br> If the term NOT is used in one of the lists, subsequent terms in
 that list will be negated.
