/**
 * This class provides methods for serializing a VectorStore to disk.<p>
 * The serialization currently presumes that the object (in the ObjectVectors)
 * should be serialized as a String. <p>
 * The implementation uses Lucene's I/O package, which proved much faster
 * than the native java.io.DataOutputStream. <p>
 * In the current implementation, VectorStoreWriter objects have no
 * internal fields, since vecLength is now a global variable. The
 * writing methods could therefore be made static and done without
 * instantiation; we've left the current (slightly awkward looking)
 * instance method approach for now to see if the current
 * implementation of vecLength and writers holds up in practice.
