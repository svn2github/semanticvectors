 * Command line term vector comparison utility. This enables users to
 get raw similarities between two concepts. These concepts may be
 individual words or lists of words. For example, if your vectorfile
 is the (default) termvectors.bin, you should be able to run
 comparisons like 

 <br>
 <code>java pitt.search.semanticvectors.CompareTerms "blue" "red green"
 </code>

 <br> 
 which will give you the cosine similarity of the "blue"
 vector with the sum of the "red" and "green" vectors.

 <br> If the term NOT is used in one of the lists, subsequent terms in 
 that list will be negated.
