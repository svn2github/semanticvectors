Vector utilities for use with Semantic Vectors.

In particular, these can be used to generate principal component plots
of lists of term vectors.

Because they depend on external dependencies (e.g., Jama), these utils
are not compiled as part of the standard SemanticVectors "ant" build
target.

If you want to compile these utils, make sure the directory in which
you placed the Jama distribution is part of your CLASSPATH and run
"ant compile-util".

Run using (e.g.) java pitt.util.vectors.PrincipalComponents <SEARCHARGS>
(This is similar to usage for java pitt.search.semanticvectors.ClusterResults)
